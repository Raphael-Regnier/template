      The Force has always been a mysterious and powerful element in the Star Wars universe.
      With the arrival of new characters, we're seeing fresh interpretations and manifestations
      of this cosmic energy.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The New Generation</h2>
    <p>
      From Rey to Kylo Ren, the new generation of Force users brings unique perspectives
      and abilities to the Star Wars saga. Their journey of discovery mirrors our own
      exploration of the expanded Star Wars universe.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Legacy of the Jedi</h2>
    <p>
      While the traditional Jedi Order may be gone, its legacy lives on through these
      new characters. They face similar challenges but must find their own path in
      a galaxy that has changed dramatically since the time of the Old Republic.
